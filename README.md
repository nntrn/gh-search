# gh-search

## Usage

```sh
export GITHUB_TOKEN=..

gh-search \
  --search <SEARCH_TERM> \
  --language <LANGUAGE> \
  --user <USER> \
  --org <ORG> \
  --repo <REPO> \
  --extension <EXT> \
  --per-page <NUM> \
  --path <PATH> \
  --out <DIR>
```

## Examples

- Search for **shell** scripts owned by **github** that contain **api.github.com**

  ```sh
  gh-search --search api.github.com --language shell --org github
  ```

- Search **jq** files that **def**ine functions and output first **10** to **/tmp/jq**

  ```sh
  gh-search --search def --extension jq --per-page 10 --out /tmp/jq
  ```

- **Search github for files that mention your username that isn't owned by you**  
  (hopefully your username isn't something common)

  ```sh
  gh-search --search nntrn --not --user nntrn --out /tmp/github_nntrn
  cd /tmp/github_nntrn
  grep -r nntrn .
  ```

## Considerations

- By default, bare search terms search both paths and file content.

- Except with `filename` searches, you must always include at least one search term  
  (i.e. **q=language:javascript** is not valid but **q=football+language:javascript** is ok)

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` is required to search code

- Code in forks is only searchable if the fork has more stars than the parent repository

- Only the **default branch** is indexed for code search

- Only files smaller than 384 KB are searchable

- Up to 4,000 private repositories are searchable

- Only repositories with fewer than 500,000 files are searchable

- You can't use the following wildcard characters as part of your search query:  
  `` . , : ; / \ ` ' " = * ! ? # $ & + ^ | ~ < > ( ) { } [ ] @ ``
